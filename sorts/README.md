# Sorts

- bubble and selection aren't great, both worst case n^2, bubble best case is n
- space for both is constant

- insertion sort is good for small and mostly sorted data
- best case linear, worst cast is n^2
- space is constant

- merge sort is good with best, avg,  worst nlogn
- space is linear which could be an issue

- quick sort matches merge sort but is n^2 in worst case
- space is logn so better if pivot point chosen avoids worse case time 

- if really worried about worst case and space use heapsort
