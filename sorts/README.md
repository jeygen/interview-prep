# Sorts

- bubble and selection aren't great, both worst case n^2, bubble best case is n
- space for both is constant
- if data almost sorted then bubble sort is a great choice

- insertion sort is good for small and mostly sorted data
- best case linear, worst cast is n^2
- space is constant

- merge sort is good with best, avg,  worst nlogn
- space is linear which could be an issue
- unknown data

- quick sort matches merge sort but is n^2 in worst case
- space is logn so better if pivot point chosen avoids worse case time 
- great for uniform, randomly distributed data

- if really worried about worst case and space use heapsort
