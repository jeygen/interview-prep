Implementing a stack in python, java, js, and c.

Different implementations will take different approaches. 

Last in first out. 

Account for stack-over/underflow.

push() - add object to top of stack
pop() - remove object from top of stack
isEmpty() - check if stack is empty
top() - returns top object, but does not remove from stack. Error if stack is empty.
